<title>Permissions overview</title>
</head><body>SIDs may be in either numerical or friendly name form. If you use a numerical form, affix the wildcard character * to the beginning of the SID.<br/>
<br/>
  icacls preserves the canonical order of ACE entries as:<br/>
<br/>
    Explicit denials<br/>
    Explicit grants<br/>
    Inherited denials<br/>
    Inherited grants<br/>
<br/>
  Perm is a permission mask that can be specified in one of the following forms:<br/>
<br/>
    A sequence of simple rights:<br/>
      F (full access)<br/>
      M (modify access)<br/>
      RX (read and execute access)<br/>
      R (read-only access)<br/>
      W (write-only access)<br/>
    A comma-separated list in parenthesis of specific rights:<br/>
      D (delete)<br/>
      RC (read control)<br/>
      WDAC (write DAC)<br/>
      WO (write owner)<br/>
      S (synchronize)<br/>
      AS (access system security)<br/>
      MA (maximum allowed)<br/>
      GR (generic read)<br/>
      GW (generic write)<br/>
      GE (generic execute)<br/>
      GA (generic all)<br/>
      RD (read data/list directory)<br/>
      WD (write data/add file)<br/>
      AD (append data/add subdirectory)<br/>
      REA (read extended attributes)<br/>
      WEA (write extended attributes)<br/>
      X (execute/traverse)<br/>
      DC (delete child)<br/>
      RA (read attributes)<br/>
      WA (write attributes)<br/>
<br/>
  Inheritance rights may precede either Perm form, and they are applied only to directories:<br/>
<br/>
    (OI): object inherit<br/>
    (CI): container inherit<br/>
    (IO): inherit only<br/>
    (NP): do not propagate inherit<br/>
    (I): permission inherited from parent container<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  (I) &quot;Inherited&quot;: This ACE was inherited from the parent container.<br/>
  (OI) &quot;Object inherit&quot;: This ACE will be inherited by objects placed in this container.<br/>
  (CI) &quot;Container inherit&quot;: This ACE will be inherited by subcontainers placed in this container.<br/>
  (IO) &quot;Inherit only&quot;: This ACE will be inherited (see OI and CI), but does not apply to this object itself.<br/>
  (NP) &quot;Do not propagate&quot;: This ACE will be inherited by objects and subcontainers one level deep â€“ it will not apply to things inside subcontainers.<br/>
